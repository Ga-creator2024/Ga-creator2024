    "text": "Hello Everyone!\nI am currently a Case PREP scholar, here at Case Western Reserve University. I got my undergraduate degree in Biology (B.S.). I decided to pursue this post-bas oppurtunity because I wanted to pursue biomedical research instead of entomology research. A lot of my prior research experiences had been entomology based, and I realized I needed more training. I am super excited to have this oppunruintiy and be able to expand my knowledge of all things research!\nHere’s a quick blurb of my personal statement just to tell you more about who I am, and why I want a Ph.D.!\n“As a first-generation, biracial student with bilateral hearing loss, my personal experiences with healthcare have fueled my commitment to biomedical research that informs prevention and treatment strategies, particularly for underrepresented populations. Upon completing my PhD, I aim to lead research utilizing data-driven approaches to address healthcare disparities and improve patient outcomes.”\nBeing a first-generation student has awalys been such a huge portion of my life and my identity. In addition, being a biracial student with a disability, I hope to one day be an inspiration for others. :)"

    "text": "I have two dogs. Piper (left) is our newest addition to the family. She has lots of energy, and we just ordered a DNA test to try and figure out her breed. She was reasuced from a farm, and she is very healthy nowdays! She LOVES to go to the dog park, and one of her quirks is barking at fake plants and random books in her free time.\nTo the right of piper, is our older dog Luna. She was my families first puppy. Compared to Piper she is about 3 times smaller. Luna is very relaxed, and loves to cuddle. She is super friendly and will great any guest with lots of love! Luna’s quirk is barking at the heater when its first turns on, and then lays next to it and takes a nap.\nAs of right now, the two dogs get along to some extent. They tend to bicker like any siblings. Family and I think that as time goes on, the sibling rivarly will decrease."

    "text": "Toxin Sequestration and Natural Predators of the Spotted Lanternfly\nDuring the summer of 2023, I researched toxin sequestration and natural predators of the spotted lanternfly under the supervision of Dr. Kelli Hoover and her graduate student at Penn State University. Current methods to control spotted lanternflies (SLF) are harmful to the environment, so the goal of our experiment was to find natural predators to decrease the population of this invasive species. Finding natural predators for SLFs can be challenging because they have a defense mechanism called toxin sequestration that makes them taste unpalatable to predators. Based on prior research conducted by her graduate student, we found that various species of birds such as house wrens could be effective natural predators. We devised an experiment that observed if the birds could differentiate SLF reared from grapevines, meaning they have not undergone toxin sequestration, or SLF reared from the tree of heaven, meaning they have undergone toxin sequestration. We recorded their behaviors such as the birds eating the SLF, discarding the SLF, or feeding the SLF to their baby chicks. The results were not statistically significant, and we determined this could have been due to the small sample size. If I were still in this lab, I would continue collecting data on the bird’s behavior to see if they were effective natural predators."

    "text": "The Effect of Sucrose and Bacteria on the pH Levels of the Oral Cavity\nDuring my freshman year, I had my first exposure to research called the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI). It was the first time in my academic career that I was able to design my own experiment. I investigated the effect of sucrose and bacteria on the pH levels of the oral cavity. This experiment allowed me to develop skills such as PCR and DNA amplification. We used solid media plates to swab and collect data, and if the media plate was stored improperly, it led to the plate cracking. In conclusion, I was unable to harness enough data to gain accurate results."
