# Welcome to my website!

Hello Everyone, 

My name is Gabrielle Davis, and I am 22 years old. I am currently a Case PREP scholar here at Case Western Reserve University. My current research interest include diabetes, cancer, and health outcomes. This website contains my projects (past and present), a section about me, my CV, and my pets!

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.gxd218@case.edu) if you would like to discuss my research! I would be more than happy to connect with anyone!
